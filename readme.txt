This plugin allows you to display your telephone number around the website via the [phone_number] shortcode.

== Description ==

Hardcoding a telephone number in various locations of your website can often be a bad idea. If the telephone number changes, you'll have to manually change it throughout every location of your website. This plugin allows you to store a single phone number on the database and retrieve it easily using the shortcode `[phone_number]`.
